\title{KmeansMeanSD}
\description{
Function KmeansMeanSD takes the 2D array generated by the function ReadDD and be clustered into a number of clusters and returns their Means and SDs.
}
\usage{
KmeansMeanSD(transformed2Darray, nClusters, nstart, itermax, Vis)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{transformed2Darray}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{transformed2Darray} here~~
2D array.
}
  \item{nClusters}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{nClusters} here~~
Number of clusters
}
  \item{nstart}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{nstart} here~~
See R kmeans. 
}
  \item{itermax}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{itermax} here~~
See R kmeans. 
}
  \item{Vis}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{Vis} here~~
If 0 no visualization, if 1 with visualization.
}
}
\details{
These MFI Means and SDs will be first converted to MESF Means and SDs using the function MFI2MESF.
}
\value{
Output for each cluster the statistics: MFI Mean and standard deviation (SD).
